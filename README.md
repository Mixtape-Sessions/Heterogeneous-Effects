## About

The holy grail of causal inference is the individual-level treatment effect: how would a particular patient respond to a drug? Which users  will respond most to a targeted ad? Would a given student be helped or harmed by a classroom intervention? This session introduces machine learning tools for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects like random causal forests. The course goes over the theory and concepts as well as the nitty-gritty of coding the methods up in python, R, and Stata using real-world examples. This course can be taken as a follow-up to the Machine Learning and Causal Inference mixtape session, or as a stand-alone course.
